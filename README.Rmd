Download ArcGIS FeatureServer and MapServer Data to Simple Features

The [ArcGIS FeatureServer](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/windows/what-is-a-feature-service-.htm) or [MapServer](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/latest/publish-services/windows/what-is-a-map-service.htm) services are among the most common sources for geospatial data. The esri2sf package enables users to download data from an ArcGIS Server to a simple feature (sf) or data frame object using the [ArcGIS REST API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/). You can learn more about [working with sf objects](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html) in the documentation for the [sf package](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/).

## How esri2sf works

This package takes the layer URL and query (created from a bounding box, geometry, and other parameters). Typically, the ArcGIS REST API limits the maximum number of rows that can be returned from a single query. This package uses [httr2](https://httr2.r-lib.org/) to query the server and initially returns the ID for all features and then batches the IDs to return all requested features from the server.

The geometry is returned as a [FeatureSet object](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/common-data-types/featureset-object.htm) (also known as an ESRI JSON object). The JSON is converted into an sf object and combined with the attribute data to return an sf data frame.

## Install

Use [pak](https://pak.r-lib.org/) to install this package from GitHub:

``` r
pak::pkg_install("yonghah/esri2sf")
```

## How to use esri2sf

To use esri2sf, you need is the URL of a FeatureServer or MapServer layer you want to download. You can get the URL by viewing the URL widget on the service's webpage (see image below), by asking a GIS admin, or looking at the code of a webpage where it creates a feature layer.

You can then use the url with esri2sf to download data:

```{r points}
library(esri2sf)
url <- "https://services.arcgis.com/V6ZHFr6zdgNZuVG0/arcgis/rest/services/Landscape_Trees/FeatureServer/0"

df <- esri2sf(url)

plot(df)
```

<!-- ![point plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3218468/29668766-544723a2-88af-11e7-8852-e8f7d21ffd5b.png) -->

### Select fields using `outFields`

You can select specific output fields. You can check the names of the data source columns using the `esrimeta()` function with `fields = TRUE`. Set `progress = TRUE` to show a progress bar for larger downloads (such as this 18000 polyline data).

```{r polyline}
url <- "https://services.arcgis.com/V6ZHFr6zdgNZuVG0/arcgis/rest/services/Florida_Annual_Average_Daily_Traffic/FeatureServer/0"

esrimeta(url, fields = TRUE)

df <- esri2sf(url, outFields = c("AADT", "DFLG"))

plot(df)
```

<!-- ![line plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3218468/29668781-5dc1f4de-88af-11e7-8680-4d2ad648e04f.png) -->

### Filter rows using `where` 

You can filter rows as well by providing a `where` condition in standardized SQL (SQL-92) that is applied to non-spatial attributes. See[ the ArcGIS documentation](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/portal/latest/use/calculate-fields.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_28F344E2E80C410A98D443FF301DF989) for more information on supported operators and functions.

```{r polygon}
url <- "https://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/ESRI_Census_USA/MapServer/3"

mi <- esri2sf(
  url,
  where = "STATE_NAME = 'Michigan'",
  outFields = c("POP2000", "pop2007", "POP00_SQMI", "POP07_SQMI")
)

plot(mi)
```

<!-- ![polygon plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3218468/29668791-63e66976-88af-11e7-9f6c-5d95bac4a69e.png) -->

### Use `esri2df()` to download tabular data

You can download non-spatial tables of the 'Table' layer type using `esri2df()`.

```{r tables}
df <- esri2df("https://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/WaterTemplate/WaterDistributionInventoryReport/MapServer/5", objectIds = paste(1:50, collapse = ","))

df
```

In some cases, tables may include coordinates as numeric attribute columns but no geometry. If this is the case, you can create a bounding box filter condition using the following format:

```{r}
# Using the Michigan sf data to create a bbox
bbox <- sf::st_bbox(mi)
coords <- c("longitude", "latitude")

where <- paste0(c(
  sprintf("(%s >= %s)", coords[1], bbox$xmin),
  sprintf("(%s <= %s)", coords[1], bbox$xmax),
  sprintf("(%s >= %s)", coords[2], bbox$ymin),
  sprintf("(%s <= %s)", coords[2], bbox$ymax)
),
collapse = " AND "
)

where
```

### Using the `crs` parameter

When specifying the CRS parameter, any transformation that happens will be done within the ArcGIS REST API. Caution should be taken when specifying an output `crs` that requires a datum transformation as ESRI will automatically apply a default transformation (with no feedback as to which one) which could end up adding small unexpected errors into your data.

By default, `esri2sf()` will transform any data to WGS 1984 (EPSG:4326), but it may be safer to set `crs = NULL` which will return the data in the same CRS as the host service. You can also set an alternate default crs using `options`, e.g. `options("esri2sf.crs", 3857)`.

```{r}
url <- "https://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services/Demographics/ESRI_Census_USA/MapServer/3"
where <- "STATE_NAME = 'Michigan'"
outFields <- c("POP2000", "pop2007", "POP00_SQMI", "POP07_SQMI")

# default crs = 4326
esri2sf(url, where = where, outFields = outFields)

# No transformation (recommended)
esri2sf(url, where = where, outFields = outFields, crs = NULL)
```

Since the addition of the `WKT1_ESRI` output from `sf::st_crs()` in sf version 1.0-1, you can enter common CRS format (any that `sf::st_crs()` can handle) into the `crs` parameters and it will be able to convert to the ESRI formatted WKT needed for the outSR field in the REST query.

Below are examples of the variety of input types that you can use with the `crs` parameters. All examples are just different formulations of the ESRI:102690 CRS.

```{r}
# ESRI Authority Code
df1 <- esri2sf(url, where = where, outFields = outFields, crs = "ESRI:102690")
# PROJ string
df2 <- esri2sf(url, where = where, outFields = outFields, crs = "+proj=lcc +lat_1=42.1 +lat_2=43.66666666666666 +lat_0=41.5 +lon_0=-84.36666666666666 +x_0=4000000 +y_0=0 +datum=NAD83 +units=us-ft +no_defs")
# OGC WKT
df3 <- esri2sf(url, where = where, outFields = outFields, crs = 'PROJCS["NAD_1983_StatePlane_Michigan_South_FIPS_2113_Feet",GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983",DATUM["North_American_Datum_1983",SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137,298.257222101]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Lambert_Conformal_Conic_2SP"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",13123333.33333333],PARAMETER["False_Northing",0],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-84.36666666666666],PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_1",42.1],PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_2",43.66666666666666],PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",41.5],UNIT["Foot_US",0.30480060960121924],AUTHORITY["EPSG","102690"]]')
```

Their similarity on the output CRS can be proven by the following function that calculates the mean difference in X-Y coordinates at each point. All are very close to 0.

```{r}
coord_diff <- function(df1, df2) {
  suppressWarnings({
    c(
      "x" = mean(sf::st_coordinates(sf::st_cast(df1, "POINT"))[, 1] - sf::st_coordinates(sf::st_cast(df2, "POINT"))[, 1]),
      "y" = mean(sf::st_coordinates(sf::st_cast(df1, "POINT"))[, 2] - sf::st_coordinates(sf::st_cast(df2, "POINT"))[, 2])
    )
  })
}
coord_diff(df1, df2)
coord_diff(df1, df3)
coord_diff(df2, df3)
```

### Additional functions

The `esriRequest()` function has also made it easier to build new functions for ArcGIS REST API services. `esriCatalog()` uses the [Catalog endpoint](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/catalog.htm) to return a list of folders and layers.

```{r}
url <- "https://sampleserver1.arcgisonline.com/ArcGIS/rest/services"

esriCatalog(url)
```

`esriIndex()` wraps `esriCatalog()` but returns a data frame with added columns to differentiate between folder, service, and layer URLs.

```{r}
esriIndex(url)
```

Set `recurse = TRUE` to loop through folders and ensure the data frame includes all available services.

```{r}
esriIndex(url, recurse = TRUE)
```

Similarly, the new `esrigeocode()` provides support for the [Find Address Candidates](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/find-address-candidates.htm) and [Reverse Geocode](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/services-reference/enterprise/reverse-geocode.htm) REST APIs.

```{r}
url <- "https://geodata.baltimorecity.gov/egis/rest/services/Locator/EGISCompositeLocator/GeocodeServer"

esrigeocode(url, address = "100 HOLLIDAY STREET")
```
